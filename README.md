Water Intake Tracker
===============

Topic and Purpose
-----------------

The Water Intake Tracker is an app built with Flutter and Dart to interactively track a user's daily water intake. The user is able to set their information, such as activity level and weight, to get a recommended daily water intake goal. Depending on the recommended amount, 8oz cups are rendered on the screen, which the user can then tap, simulating a cup fill, allowing them to track their water intake for the day.
